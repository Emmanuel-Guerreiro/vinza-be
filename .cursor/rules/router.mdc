- Prefer put over patch
- Always create the OpenAPI comments to document the endpoints
- Within OpenAPI comments, if its a get method, use the params schema at the params file in the same directory and the model to generate the filtering options
- Within OpenAPI comments, if its a post or update method, use the schemas and model in the same directory to create the creation and update objects
- Within OpenAPI comments, if its a post or update method, try to provide examples for the fields. Otherwise dont provide default values.
- Within OpenAPI comments, remember to define the responses.
- If its a new router, include it at @src/app.ts initializeRouter
- Dont create validations at OpenApi comment levels, let the controller with zod validate and return
